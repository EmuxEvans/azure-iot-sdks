# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect {enter your device name here} device running {enter the OS name running on device} with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   {enter your device name here} device.
-   {{Please specify if any other software(s) or hardware(s) are required.}}

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   {{Write down the instructions required to setup, configure and connect your device. Please use external links when possible pointing to your own page with device preparation steps.}}

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:
{{***Keep the command set based on your OS and remove the rest.***}}

    {{**Debian or Ubuntu**}}

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre

    {{**Fedora**}}

        sudo dnf check-update -y

        sudo dnf install libcurl-devel openssl-devel libuuid-devel uuid-devel gcc-c++ make cmake git unzip java-1.7.0-openjdk

    {{**Any Other Linux OS**}}

        Write equivalent commands on the target OS

    {{***If any other software is required, please specify here the command(s) for installing same.***}}

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:
    {{***Keep the file based on your protocol(s) and remove the rest.***}}

    {{**For AMQP protocol:**}}

        azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    {{**For HTTPS protocol:**}}

        azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:
{{***Keep the command set based on your protocol(s) and remove the rest.***}}

    {{**If using AMQP protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    {{**If using HTTP protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http

    {{**If using MQTT protocol:**}}

        ~/azure-iot-sdks/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

# Tips

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/linux
  make -f makefile.linux all
  ```
